## Rendering Journal

Documentation for the Ray Tracer/Path Tracer Swiss Army Knife Project, a renderer created in Nvidia OptiX, CUDA and C++.

A configurable rendering program with a transformation stack (like OpenGL) and a BVH acceleration structure with different modes of rendering:
* [A path tracer mode with toggleable Next Event Estimation (NEE) and Russian Roulette]()
* [Direct Lighting Modes: A mode with the analytic solution to direct lighting (without shadows) and a Monte Carlo Direct Lighting mode]()
* [A simple raytracer mode with Blinn-Phong shading and mirror reflections](simpleRayTracer)
* [Final Project Proposal for CSE168](cse168finalproject)
